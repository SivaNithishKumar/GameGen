# **App Name**: Gemini Game Forge

## Core Features:

- AI-Powered Asset Generation: Generate game assets (images, code snippets, music) using natural language prompts with Gemini's multimodal capabilities. The AI is trained to follow thematic consistency across all generated assets using a tool to help guide it in these decisions.
- In-Browser Code Editor with Live Preview: A code editor powered by WebContainers that reflects any edits to a live in-browser game preview. File system changes will automatically trigger a hot-reload of the game.
- AI-Assisted Code Modification: The Gemini AI will make context-aware code modifications in real time using Gemini code generation and execution capabilities, and based on conversation and system state.
- Chat-Based Interaction: A chat interface enabling natural language interaction with the AI agent. Users can describe desired changes, request new features, or ask for assistance with debugging. The chat panel is docked on the right side of the UI.
- File explorer: The explorer lets you manage files within a panel located on the left.
- Context Preservation: The AI maintains a continuous awareness of the conversation history, project context, and user preferences to provide personalized assistance and ensure thematic consistency across all generated assets.
- HTML5 Game Export: Users can export generated games as HTML5 packages optimized for web deployment.

## Style Guidelines:

- Light Theme: Primary color: HSL(210, 50%, 40%) - a cool, deep teal (#408295) to evoke a sense of sophistication and technology.
- Light Theme: Background color: A light, desaturated blue-gray HSL(210, 10%, 90%) or hex #E5E8EA. Provides a modern, unobtrusive backdrop, reducing eye strain.
- Dark Theme: Primary color: HSL(210, 50%, 20%) - a darker teal (#20414A).
- Dark Theme: Background color: A dark, desaturated blue-gray HSL(210, 10%, 20%) or hex #33363B. Provides a modern, unobtrusive backdrop, reducing eye strain during long coding sessions.
- Body font: 'Roboto', a sans-serif, for a modern, neutral, and readable interface.
- Headline font: 'Montserrat', a sans-serif, for a tech-forward, yet approachable title.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' to display code snippets clearly.
- The chat panel will be docked to the right, the explorer panel on the left, and the preview/editor in the center.
- Use clear, minimalist icons to represent file types, actions, and tools within the interface. Ensure icons are easily recognizable and consistent with the overall design. Icons should primarily be white or a light shade of the primary color for better contrast against the dark background.
